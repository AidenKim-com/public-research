## [ATT&CK Technique Prevalence](https://github.com/redcanaryco/public-research/tree/master/technique_prevalence)

Red Canary publishes an annual Threat Detection Report that is an in-depth look at the most prevalent 
ATT&CK® techniques designed to help you and your team focus on what matters most.

This machine-readable data illustrates how often each ATT&CK technique is leveraged in a confirmed threat 
in our customers' environments.


## [Heaven's Gate for Linux](https://github.com/redcanaryco/public-research/tree/master/heavens_gate)

Heaven’s Gate was originally published as an attacker technique for Windows. This technique allowed malicious 
software to evade endpoint security products by invoking 64-bit code in 32-bit processes, effectively 
bypassing user-mode hooks. This technique has since been mitigated in Windows 10+ through Control Flow Guard (CFG).

Red Canary has been successful in reproducing a variation of this technique for Linux.
